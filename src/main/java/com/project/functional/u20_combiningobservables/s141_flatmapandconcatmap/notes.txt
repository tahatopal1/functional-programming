KEY DIFFERENCES:

Order: `flatMap` does not guarantee the order of items, whereas `concatMap` does
Performance: `flatMap` can subscribe to multiple Observables at once, potentially
improving performance by leveraging parallelism. `concatMap` subscribes to each
Observable one at a time, which can be slower but is necessary when order matters.
