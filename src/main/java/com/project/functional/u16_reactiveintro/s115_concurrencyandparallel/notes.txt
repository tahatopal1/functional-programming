Concurrent Processing in Java

This refers to the Java platform's ability to manage and execute multiple threads of execution within a single
application, potentially on a single processor. The concurrency model in Java is primarily built around threads.
Concurrency in Java allows for the development of highly responsive application that can handle multiple tasks
simultaneously, such as waiting for user input, performing background computations or managing I/O operations.
It's more about structuring your program to handle multiple tasks at once in an efficient way, rather than
executing tasks simultaneously.

Parallel Processing in Java

Parallel processing in Java is achieved by utilizing the multiple cores of a CPU to perform several operations
simultaneously, significantly speeding up computational tasks by breaking them into smaller chunks and processing
those chunks simultaneously across multiple cores. Java provides several frameworks and APIs to facilitate parallel
processing, including parallel streams and the Fork/Join Framework. These tools allow developers to write code that can
automatically scale with the available hardware, performing computationally intensive operations in parallel and
leveraging modern multicore processors to their full potential.


In essence, Java's concurrency utilities help you write programs that can do many things at once (concurrently), like
handling multiple network connections or user interactions. On the other hand, Java's parallel processing capabilities
are designed to make computations faster by dividing work into independent tasks that can run simultaneously on
different cores of a multicore processor.
