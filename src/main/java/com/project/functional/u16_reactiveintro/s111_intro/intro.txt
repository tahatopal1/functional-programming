Introduction to Reactive Programming
~ Definition: Unlike its often negative connotation in everyday language, "reactive" in programming is a positive paradigm shift.
~ Comparison to Other Paradigms: Reactive programming stands alongside procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming as a distinct paradigm.
Transitioning between paradigms requires a shift in mindset but does not invalidate previous paradigms.

The Reactive Manifesto
~ Origin: Formulated by experienced developers and architects from leading tech companies.
~ Purpose: Establishes guidelines for building modern, responsive systems that exceed user expectations.

Core Principles:
~ Responsive: Systems must provide timely responses to user interactions.
~ Resilient: Systems gracefully handle errors and failures.
~ Elastic: Systems adjust to varying loads without manual intervention.
~ Message-Driven: Systems ensure loose coupling and asynchronous for more responsive interactions.

Practical Applications of Reactive Principles
~ Responsiveness Strategies: Parallel processing or asynchronous request handling to maintain user engagement.
~ Resilience in Practice: Implementing backup plans like using caches or secondary databases to mitigate system failures.
~ Elasticity Examples: Cloud, distributed systems, and microservices can dynamically scale to handle increased load.
~ Message-Driven Communication: Preferring asynchronous over synchronous communication to enhance system responsiveness and decoupling.

Introduction to ReactiveX and RxJava
~ ReactiveX: A comprehensive library for asynchronous programming with observable streams, initiated by Netflix.
~ RxJava: A JVM implementation of ReactiveX, focusing on making systems reactive with version 3.x being the latest at the time of the course.
~ Learning Curve: Emphasizes that understanding and adopting ReactiveX and RxJava may initially be challenging but becomes more intuitive with practice.
