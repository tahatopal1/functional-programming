Observable vs Flowable

Observable
    ¬  Backpressure: Doesn't handle backpressure by default, meaning it can overwhelm downstream
    consumers if they can't keep up.
    ¬  Usage: Best suited for event-driven data streams, like user interface events, where
    backpressure isn't an issue

Flowable:
    ¬  Backpressure: Supports backpressure, providing different strategies (Buffer, Drop, etc.)
    to overwhelming data flows.
    ¬  Usage: Ideal for handling high-throughput or potentially overwhelming data streams,
    as it can prevent subscribers from being flooded with more data than they can handle.
    ¬  When source is emitting large amount of data it's a more suitable choice.
